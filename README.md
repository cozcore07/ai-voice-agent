# **🤖 AI Voice Appointment Scheduler for Dental Clinics**

Creating an AI-powered voice appointment scheduler involves integrating voice recognition, natural language processing, and real-time scheduling APIs. This project provides a foundational implementation of an AI voice assistant tailored for dental clinics, designed to understand spoken commands, check appointment availability, and schedule visits via seamless integration with Praktika or similar software.

✅ 1. Project Scope Overview

🦷 Core Features:

AI Voice Assistant
Listens to user requests, understands natural language using OpenAI Whisper & GPT, and responds clearly.

Appointment Scheduling
Syncs with Praktika’s scheduling system (or simulated endpoint) to fetch availability and confirm bookings.

Conversation Memory
Maintains context during the conversation for a natural flow and precise interaction.

Easy Integration
Designed with modular architecture to extend to real clinic systems or VoIP lines.

🛠️ Tech Stack Recommendation

📱 AI Voice Bot Stack:

Languages & Frameworks: Node.js, Express.js

Voice & NLP: OpenAI Whisper API, GPT API

Audio Streaming: WebSockets + Speech-to-Text conversion

Scheduler Integration: REST API structure (Praktika-ready)

Frontend (optional): HTML/JS demo with audio input recording

Deployment: Works on local or cloud environments (Heroku, Vercel, AWS)

🔗 This base code can be extended to production-grade systems that handle inbound clinic calls or integrate with voice gateways like Twilio or SIP clients.

📦 Project Uses
This project is ideal for:

Dental clinics wanting to automate appointment booking via phone.

Developers building AI-driven scheduling bots for healthcare or service businesses.

Voice assistant prototypes that need practical real-world use cases.
